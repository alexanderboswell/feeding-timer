# Baby feeding timer

The first few weeks of a newborn are some of the most precious and exhausting moments. For first time parents the added stress and anxiety of so many new things can make the juggle of tasks even more difficult. 

For a baby that is having a difficult time breast feeding or is formula feed, it is [recommended](https://kidshealth.org/Nemours/en/parents/formulafeed-often.html) to feed them every 2-3 hours. To help cope through sleep deprivation and general lack of tracking time, with just the flick of a wrist you can easily see when the next bottle feeding should be!
